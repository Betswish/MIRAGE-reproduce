These investments often come with hefty valuations, which may not reflect the company's current profitability.  Document explains that venture capital investments involve a high degree of risk, with many startups failing to achieve their projected growth.  As a result, venture capitalists often prioritize scalability and potential for future growth over immediate profitability.
