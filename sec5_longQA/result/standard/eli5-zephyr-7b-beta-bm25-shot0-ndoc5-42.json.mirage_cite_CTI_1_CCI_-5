[5] While pasteurized eggs can significantly reduce the risk of salmonella, other ingredients in the dough, such as nuts and chocolate, have also been associated with foodborne illnesses.  Therefore, it's best to refrain from eating raw cookie dough to avoid the potential health risks.  However, some companies, like Cookie Dough Bites, are producing pre-packaged cookie dough that is made with heat-treated flour and pasteurized eggs, reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses.  As a precaution, it's always recommended to follow food safety guidelines and thoroughly cook any dough before consumption."

            "output": "[5][4][3] According to various sources, a significant portion of the trash that ends up in our oceans actually originates from land-based activities, not just from ships discarding their waste. [3] In fact, as much as 80% of ocean plastic pollution comes from land sources. [5] The majority of this waste is carried to the oceans by ten rivers, which all flow through densely populated areas with inadequate waste management systems. [5][3] This issue is compounded by the fact that most types of marine debris, such as plastics, are not biodegradable, meaning they can persist in the environment for centuries. [3][4][5][2] Once in the ocean, this waste can become incorporated into physical ocean features such as currents and gyres, leading to the formation of large, swirling vortexes of trash, commonly known as marine trash islands. [4][2] These islands of waste, such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, pose a significant threat to marine life and ecosystems as a whole.  It's clear that addressing the root causes of ocean plastic pollution, including improving waste management systems and reducing single-use plastics, is crucial to preventing further harm to our oceans and the creatures that call them home."
